### Smart India Hackathon 2023 - PSID-1368 (Finalist)

I was a finalist at Smart India Hackathon 2023 with PSID-1368 under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India.

#### Problem Statement:

The challenge was to mitigate unsafe sewer and septic tank cleaning practices, focusing on the harmful gases present in these environments, posing risks to the workers.

#### Solution:

We developed a multi-gas detector sensor capable of identifying harmful gases in sewers and septic tanks to ensure worker safety.

- Utilized sensors: MQ-2, MQ-7, MQ-135, MQ-136.
- Detection of hazardous gases triggers a buzzer alert.
- The contractor receives an immediate alert and can evacuate the worker promptly.

#### Skills Utilized:

- **Programming:** Arduino IDE, IFTTT, ESP8266.
- **Presentation:** Development and delivery.
- **Internet of Things (IoT):** Thingspeak.
- **Project Management:** Ensuring efficient project execution.
- **Teamwork:** Collaborated effectively with team members.
- **Communication:** Effectively communicated project details and outcomes.
- **MATLAB and Simulink:** Used for additional analysis and simulations.

This project aimed to address a critical issue, and being a finalist at Smart India Hackathon 2023 was a rewarding experience that honed my skills in various domains.
